# 📦 Shipping Automation – Part 2: Label Booking & Fulfillment

## Overview

This automation is **Part 2 of the Shipping workflow** and performs **the majority of the operational work**.

Once triggered, it:

- Books the shipment
- Generates and prints the shipping label
- Creates a shipping invoice (with markup)
- Sends tracking information to the customer

This is the **final execution step** in the shipping process.

---

## 🎯 What This Automation Does

When successfully run, the automation will:

- 📄 Generate the **shipment label**
- 🖨️ Print the label at the shop
- 💰 Generate a **shipping invoice** with a **20% markup**
- 📬 Send the **tracking number to the customer**
- ✅ Mark the shipment as completed

---

## 🔗 Prerequisite

- The **uploaded quote sheet** from **Part 1 (NetParcel Quote Automation)** must exist
- A carrier/service must be selected from that sheet

---

## 🚚 Selecting a Shipper

1. Open the uploaded **quote spreadsheet**
2. Choose a shipping service
    - Example used: **ICS Next Day**
3. Mark the selected service with an **“X”**
4. Save the sheet

This selection determines which carrier and service will be booked.

---

## 🔔 How to Trigger the Automation

### Trigger Status

- Set the shipment status to:
    - **Book Label**

Once this status is selected:

- The automation immediately begins
- No additional user input is required

---

## 🔄 Status Flow & Meanings

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Awaiting Review** | Default state after quotes are generated |
| **Booking** | Automation is actively running |
| **Done** | Label booked and process completed |
| **Failed** | Automation failed (details provided) |

### Failure Handling

- If the automation fails:
    - A failure reason is shown
    - Details are added as **comments on the Monday.com item**
    - Common cause: missing or unmapped data fields

---

## ⏱️ Real-Time Execution

- The automation runs **in real time**
- Typical completion time: **a few seconds**
- Status updates from **Book Label → Booking → Done**

---

## 📄 Outputs Generated

Once complete, the following are produced:

- ✅ **Tracking number**
    - Automatically sent to the customer via email
- 📦 **PDF shipping label**
    - Stored and accessible on the item
- 🧾 **Shipping invoice**
    - Generated with a **20% markup**
- 🖨️ **Printed label**
    - Automatically prints at the shop

---

## 🧠 Behind-the-Scenes Logic (High-Level)

The automation performs the following steps:

1. Identifies the item where **Book Label** was triggered
2. Collects all shipment details
3. Matches the selected service from the quote spreadsheet
4. Applies internal logic and mappings
5. Sends an API call to **NetParcel** to book the shipment
6. Applies pickup logic:
    - If booked **in the afternoon**, pickup is scheduled for the **next day**
7. Generates:
    - PDF label
    - Tracking number
    - Invoice
8. Prints the label and emails tracking to the customer

---

## 🕒 Best Time to Run

For optimal pickup handling:

- **Early morning**, or
- **End of day**

This ensures correct pickup scheduling logic is applied.

---

## 📎 Label Verification

- Generated labels are:
    - Fully valid
    - Accessible directly from the item
- Labels can be reviewed or re-downloaded at any time
